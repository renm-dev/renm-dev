# RENM-DEV • Quiet Legacy Builder from the Cordilleras

🌱 **Ethical Technologist • Healing Designer • Legacy Mentor**

Hi, I'm Renm—a creator rooted in the highlands of Baguio and Cordillera culture, where quiet strength meets modular innovation. I bridge old-school logic (Print Master, MS Paint, WordStar) with modern stacks like React, Tailwind, Node.js, Prisma, and Docker. Every project I build carries a story, a safety net, and a soul.

## 🔧 Projects & Philosophy

- 🧩 **BukodCare** – Healing-focused community tech with modular UI, local ethics, and fallback plans.
- 📚 **EdukPrompt Kits** – AI literacy toolkits for introverts, educators, and Filipino creators.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Scam Advocacy** – Copyright protection, digital literacy, and quiet empowerment.
- 💾 **Legacy Dev Camp** – Guiding  friends through debugging, refactoring, and flowchart-first coding.

## 🧠 Stack & Style

- Old school + New school: WordStar → VSCode
- Dev rituals: `.md` docs, kamote logs, itapon mo backups
- Teaching style: Debug, reflect, retry. No shortcut culture.

## 🎶 Inside Jokes & Dev Vibes

- Touch-move chess coding ♟️
- "Dagdag-bawas until mamuti ang buhok"
- “If it breaks, it teaches. If it heals, it stays.”
